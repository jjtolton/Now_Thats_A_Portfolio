# Problem Statement
#
# The professor is conducting a course on Discrete Mathematics to a class of N students.
# He is angry at the lack of their discipline, and he decides to cancel the class if there are
# fewer than K students present after the class starts.
#
# Given the arrival time of each student, your task is to find out if the class gets cancelled or not.
#
# Input Format
#
# The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines.
# The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N and K.
# The next line contains N space-separated integers, a1,a2,…,aN, representing the arrival time of each student.
#
# If the arrival time of a given student is a non-positive integer (ai≤0),
# then the student enters before the class starts. If the arrival time of a given student is a positive integer (ai>0),
# the student enters after the class has started.
#
# Output Format
#
# For each testcase, print "YES" (without quotes) if the class gets cancelled and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
#
# Constraints
#
# 1≤T≤10
# 1≤N≤1000
# 1≤K≤N
# −100≤ai≤100,where i∈[1,N]
# Note
# If a student enters the class exactly when it starts (ai=0),
# the student is considered to have entered before the class has started.
#
# Sample Input
#
# 2
# 4 3
# -1 -3 4 2
# 4 2
# 0 -1 2 1
# Sample Output
#
# YES
# NO
# Explanation
#
# For the first test case, K=3, i.e., the professor wants at least 3 students to be in class but
# there are only 2 who have arrived on time (−3 and −1), hence the class gets cancelled.
#
# For the second test case, K=2, i.e, the professor wants at least 2 students to be in class
# and there are 2 who have arrived on time (0 and −1), hence the class does not get cancelled.
